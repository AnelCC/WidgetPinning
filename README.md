# Widget pinned

### What is widget pinning?

Widget pinning is a feature that allows users to keep a specific widget on their screen, preventing it from being minimized or hidden by other windows or apps. It essentially locks the widget in place, ensuring it remains visible and accessible.

### Widget discoverability
On devices running Android 8.0 (API level 26) and higher, launchers that let users create pinned shortcuts also let them pin widgets onto their home screen. Similar to pinned shortcuts, these pinned widgets give users access to specific tasks in your app and can be added to the home screen directly from the app, as shown in the following video.
